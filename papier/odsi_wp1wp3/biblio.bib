	abstract = {Increasing utilizations of kill switches, remote deletion, and intelligent agents as a part of “Internet of Things” (IoT) architectures present emerging cybersecurity and privacy challenges. These issues are compounded in complexity by the frequent updates and other controls instituted by the growing assortment of purveyors of household IoT devices and systems. This paper proposes that aspects of user ownership, awareness, and voice be clarified and in some venues fostered in part to expose as quickly as possible potential technological and social dangers. It addresses rights of household participants to obtain knowledge and control over the intelligent IoT agents operating (and perhaps “quartering”) in their personal and intimate spheres, as well as to be free from inappropriately opportunistic applications associated with IoT systems.},

	abstract = {The explosion in Internet-connected household devices, such as light-bulbs, smoke-alarms, power-switches, and webcams, is creating new vectors for attacking “smart-homes” at an unprecedented scale. Common perception is that smart- home IoT devices are protected from Internet attacks by the perimeter security offered by home routers. In this pa- per we demonstrate how an attacker can infiltrate the home network via a doctored smart-phone app. Unbeknownst to the user, this app scouts for vulnerable IoT devices within the home, reports them to an external entity, and modifies the firewall to allow the external entity to directly attack the IoT device. The ability to infiltrate smart-homes via doctored smart-phone apps demonstrates that home routers are poor protection against Internet attacks and highlights the need for increased security for IoT devices. 1.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things environments are comprised of heterogeneous devices that are continuously exchanging information and being accessed ubiquitously through lossy networks. This drives the need of a flexible, lightweight and adaptive access control mechanism to cope with the perva-sive nature of such global ecosystem, ensuring, at the same time, reliable communications between trusted devices. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a flexible trust-aware access control system for IoT (TACIoT), which provides an end-to-end and reliable security mechanism for IoT devices, based on a lightweight authorization mechanism and a novel trust modelthat has been specially devised for IoT environ-ments. TACIoT extends traditional access control systems by taking into account trust values which are based on reputation, quality of service, security considerations and devices' social relationships. TACIoT has been implemented and evaluated successfully in a real testbed for constrained and non-constrained IoT devices.},
